# 2. Reduce Mortality in High-Risk Areas
Why: Northeast and Midwest have higher death rates.
Action: Conduct hospital audits, improve medical practices, and evaluate care quality standards.

# 3. Benchmark Top-Performing Hospitals
Why: Karumuri Hospital shows strong outcomes and claim management.
Action: Use it as a training hub or standard-setter for lower-performing facilities.

# 4. Address Underperforming Departments
Why: Nephrology shows weak health outcomes.
Action: Review staff training, treatment protocols, and equipment availability.

# 5. Target Female & Child Policy Segments
Why: Low enrollment among women and children.
Action: Offer tailored family plans, maternity coverage, or children’s preventive care packages.
