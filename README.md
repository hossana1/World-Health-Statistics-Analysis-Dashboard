Cholera, Polio, and Measles have the highest global incident rates, each exceeding 8,000 reported cases. Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and Leprosy are at the lower end, with around 7,200 cases.

## Top Countries by Hospital Bed

The USA, Australia, and the UK lead in hospital bed availability. Other countries, such as Indonesia and South Africa, have significantly fewer beds per capita.

## Country Treatment Type by Urbanization Rate
![Screenshot 2025-06-06 124821](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1061e0f7-56af-4fd8-8240-6e8605880cf4)

Across all countries, medication and therapy are the dominant forms of treatment. Surgery and vaccination are used consistently but to a lesser extent. Urbanization does not significantly change treatment distribution patterns.

## 4. Diseases by Healthcare Access

Healthcare access is relatively balanced across most disease types, with slight variation. Chronic and genetic diseases receive marginally less access compared to cardiovascular or infectious diseases.

## Top Country by Vaccine Per Capita Income
![Screenshot 2025-06-06 133608](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81bd4a41-0012-4bca-bf8a-e23199d8d833)

The UK, USA, and Indonesia spend the most per capita on vaccines, with values above $104 million. In contrast, South Africa and Brazil are among the lowest, spending under $95 million per capita.

## Disease Distribution by Age Group
![Screenshot 2025-06-06 133617](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9993a097-29bb-4ced-ad45-ec8184e82f7b)

	â€¢	Ages 0â€“18: Highest prevalence of Asthma, Measles, and Polio
	â€¢	Ages 19â€“35 and 36â€“60: Dominated by Dengue, Cancer, and HIV/AIDS
	â€¢	Ages 61+: Alzheimerâ€™s, Cancer, and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease become significantly more common

## Gender by Recovery Rate
![Screenshot 2025-06-06 133650](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/733c3f3e-a3ab-4023-b0d7-1a90482364dc)

Recovery rates are nearly equal among genders:
	â€¢	Female: 33.62%
	â€¢	Male: 33.2%
	â€¢	Other: 33.17%

## Doctor Availability by Disease Category
![Screenshot 2025-06-06 133701](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f46b44d0-873a-400a-920f-beaa0d7be752)

Cardiovascular and bacterial disease categories have the highest number of available doctors. Autoimmune and infectious diseases are supported by the fewest specialists.

## Improvement in 5 Years by Disease
![Screenshot 2025-06-06 133728](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca961112-eadc-4706-8495-e9bfa71eb9b1)

Zika, HIV/AIDS, and Malaria have shown the highest levels of improvement over the last five years, all exceeding 10K improvement. Alzheimerâ€™s, Hypertension, and Parkinsonâ€™s have seen the least progress (below 9.6K).

### âœ… Recommendations Based on Dashboard Analysis

## Top Disease by Incident Rate
	â€¢	Prioritize national and international health campaigns targeting high-incident diseases like Cholera, Polio, and Measles.
	â€¢	Increase funding for preventive measures such as clean water, sanitation, and widespread vaccination programs.

## Top Countries by Hospital Bed
	â€¢	Countries with fewer hospital beds should invest in healthcare infrastructure to ensure capacity for routine care and emergency response.
	â€¢	Partner with global health organizations to expand hospital access in underserved regions.

## Country Treatment Type by Urbanization Rate
	â€¢	Encourage urban vaccination programs to reduce reliance on reactive treatments.
	â€¢	Expand access to advanced treatments like surgery in rural and semi-urban areas through mobile units or regional clinics.

## Diseases by Healthcare Access
	â€¢	Strengthen healthcare access for chronic and genetic diseases by subsidizing long-term treatment and follow-up care.
	â€¢	Implement policies that ensure equitable access across all disease categories, especially in lower-income populations.

## Top Country by Vaccine Per Capita Income
	â€¢	Promote global vaccine equity by supporting international partnerships (e.g., COVAX) that assist countries with lower vaccine spending.
	â€¢	Develop public-private funding models to increase vaccine affordability in lower-income nations.

## Disease Distribution by Age Group
	â€¢	Tailor health policies by age:
	â€¢	Children (0â€“18): Emphasize immunization and early screening.
	â€¢	Adults (19â€“60): Focus on sexual health, cancer screening, and chronic disease prevention.
	â€¢	Seniors (61+): Invest in geriatric care, especially for neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.

## Gender by Recovery Rate
	â€¢	Maintain and monitor gender equity in healthcare access and treatment.
	â€¢	Conduct deeper studies to detect any hidden disparities in health outcomes among underrepresented or non-binary groups.

## Doctor Availability by Disease Category
	â€¢	Provide incentives for medical specialization in underserved areas like autoimmune and infectious diseases.
	â€¢	Support training programs and scholarships for specialties with low workforce numbers.

## Improvement in 5 Years by Disease
	â€¢	Channel research and development funds toward diseases with low improvement rates, such as Alzheimerâ€™s and Parkinsonâ€™s.
	â€¢	Encourage innovative treatments and early diagnosis tools for chronic and aging-related diseases.

ðŸ“Œ Overall Strategy
	â€¢	Prevention First: Expand vaccination, sanitation, and awareness to reduce disease incidence.
	â€¢	Close Gaps: Improve access and infrastructure in lower-income countries and rural areas.
	â€¢	Targeted Investment: Allocate resources where progress is slow and disease burden is rising.
	â€¢	Data-Driven Policies: Use age, gender, and geographic data to inform tailored healthcare strategies.
